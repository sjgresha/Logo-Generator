# Logo-Generator

## Description
This week we had to make an application that generated a logo onto a SVG file using object-oriented programming. The application is run on the terminal and will ask the user a few questions about the logo they wish to make. The application then takes the answers and uses them to created the logo and svg file. 

## Installation
In order to run the application correctly the user will have to install the dependencies using the command "npm i" in the terminal.
